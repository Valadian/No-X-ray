No-X-ray
========

No X-ray is a Minecraft Bukkit server plugin that aims to end any form of x-raying being possible.

###### Features: ######
* Base protection - obfuscate whole rooms with naturally occuring underground blocks
* Entity proximity hiding - entities are hidden depending on how far away the player is from them
* Player LOS hiding - players must have non-occluding line of sight to see each other
  
Not all the features are fully implemented at the current time of writing, and on large servers I imagine that a lot of performance optimisations would be necessary. If you think you can lend a hand, feel free to help out!
